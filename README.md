# 3n-plus-1-problem

# basic definition
3n+1 problem is a simple one way problem where we take a input integer(let it be n) and then apply the following function:

n=n/2, if n is even
n=3n+1, if n is odd

we continue this process till we reach n=1

# problem
->as simple as it may look this problem has been there confusing mathematicians since decades.It is very difficult to find the number of steps it takes to reach the final value i.e. n=1 apart from actually calculating it. There is no common pattern or a specific formula to calculate this.

# Potentials
->The graphic representation of the problem shows a pattern that is totally random.It looks somewhat similar to the share market trends we see everyday.This similariy stumbled me to find if we can match or in other words combine these two totally different fields.
